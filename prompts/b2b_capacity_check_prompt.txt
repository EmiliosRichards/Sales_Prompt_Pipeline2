You are an expert business analyst. Your task is to determine if a company is primarily B2B and if it likely has an addressable market of at least 1,000 viable prospective customers (i.e., ≥1,000 organizations that could plausibly buy the product/service), based *only* on the text provided.

**Analysis Guidelines:**

1.  **B2B Status (`is_b2b`)**:
    *   **"Yes"**: The company primarily sells products or services to other businesses. This includes services like logistics, business consulting, software for companies, and wholesale goods. Keywords: "B2B", "enterprise", "business solutions", "for companies", "partners", "wholesale", "distributor", "logistics", "supply chain". A company serving both consumers and businesses is still "Yes" if a significant B2B offering is mentioned.
    *   **"No"**: The company primarily sells to individual consumers (B2C). Keywords: "personal use", "for individuals", "shop now" (in a retail context).
    *   **"Unknown"**: The text does not provide enough information to make a clear determination.

2.  **Addressable Market Status (`serves_1000_customers`)**:
    Interpret this field as “likely has ≥1,000 viable prospective customers,” not operational capacity to serve them simultaneously.
    *   **"Yes"**: The offering is horizontal (e.g., generic B2B software, standard equipment, services used across many industries) or targets a large, well-populated vertical, with operations suggesting multi-region/national/international reach (e.g., multiple offices, global presence, many industries mentioned). Indicators: “enterprise”, “for companies”, “platform”, “used by X industries”, “nationwide”, “global”, “network of partners”, “SaaS used by teams/companies”, “wholesale”.
    *   **"No"**: The product/service is very niche or hyper‑local such that there likely are <1,000 prospective organizations (e.g., a single-city service, custom one‑off integrations for a tiny segment, ultra‑specialized equipment serving a handful of institutions). Indicators: “local only”, “serves our town/community”, single small locality with no suggestion of scale, highly specialized niche with few buyers.
    *   **"Unknown"**: The text provides insufficient evidence either way.

**Output Format:**
Respond with a JSON object matching this schema. Provide a concise reason for each decision, quoting from the text if possible. Keep answers conservative; if unclear, prefer "Unknown" rather than guessing.
