POWER CAPTCHA protects your forms and login areas from attacks by bots and hackers.

Cyberattacks targeting businesses, public institutions, and users have risen sharply in recent years. Risks include:

- Data theft
- Infrastructure damage
- Abuse of online functions for spam distribution (e.g., via contact forms)
- Reputational harm

POWER CAPTCHA safeguards your website, online shop, and customers against these threats. Unlike basic CAPTCHA solutions, it offers configurable access control, letting you define who can access what, when, and how often – and when access should be blocked.
The solution is GDPR-compliant, easy to install, and compatible with most systems.
