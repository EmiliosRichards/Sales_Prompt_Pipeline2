T2med – modern, fair und kollegial

Die T2med GmbH & Co. KG wurde 2012 von dem Kieler Allgemeinmediziner Dr. Hans Joachim von
der Burchard mit der Vision gegründet, durch moderne Software eine bessere Medizin zu ermöglichen.
Aus dieser Vision ist T2med entstanden. Ein modernes, werbefreies und schnelles Programm mit leistungsstarken technischen Grundlagen, das unter Windows, Mac, Linux sowie auf iPhone und iPad läuft.

T2med basiert auf langjähriger Erfahrung in der Praxissoftware-Entwicklung und verbindet diese mit innovativen Ansätzen und ärztlichem Know-how aus dem Praxisalltag. Dabei deckt die
Software sämtliche Praxisprozesse - von der Patientenverwaltung bis zur Abrechnung - ab und ermöglicht allen Fachgruppen ein performantes und intuitives Arbeiten.

Mit zukunftsweisenden Projekten wie der Patienten-App PatMed für den direkten mobilen Austausch stärken wir das Arzt-Patienten-Verhältnis und fördern eine bessere Versorgung.

Als eigentümergeführtes Familienunternehmen in zweiter Generation legen wir großen Wert auf eine kollegiale Unternehmens- und Vertriebsphilosophie. Dabei ist uns und unseren
deutschlandweit tätigen 46 Servicepartnern der Aufbau einer langfristigen Vertrauensbasis zu unseren T2med-Praxen besonders wichtig. Diese Werte - kombiniert mit einem fairen und
transparenten Preismodell ohne Zusatzmodule - machen T2med zu einer geschätzten Praxissoftware, die echte Kollegialität lebt und mittlerweile in über 3.500 Praxen den Praxisalltag unterstützt.

Durch LearnBase starten Mitarbeitende - ob zu Hause oder im Dienst – mit eigener E-Mail-Adresse oder ohne – direkt im Browser und erwerben neue Kenntnisse. Dabei können Sie als Organisation vorhandene Lerninhalte nutzen, aber auch eigene neu erstellen.

Durch den Einsatz agiler Methoden und kurze Entwicklungszyklen, umfassende Qualitätssicherung und Feedback unserer Nutzerinnen und Nutzer, bekommt LearnBase regelmäßig neue Funktionalitäten und Inhalte dazu. Unsere Schnittstellen u.a. zu Connext Vivendi PEP und das kontinuierlich wachsende Angebot an Inhalten zeichnen uns besonders aus.
